# Git = command line tool to track changes.
# Github desktop does the same thing, but click based, user friendly.
# Github is the cloud where everything is stored


# Repository = repo = a folder on your computer that is tracked by git

# Better not use a dropbox or onedrive as local path.

# Make changes
# Commit to main = local repo
# Push to origin rempte (github)

# Revert a change:
# Go to history, right click the change you want to revert and 
# choose revert changes in commit

# If you make different changes, 
# you can commit them separately with separate comments

# You can make changes to files on github. This is not recommended.


# When changes are made somewhere else... on the desktop app
# Fetch, then Pull

# It is always a good idea to add a README.md (markdown file)
# The readme.md will always show on top in the repo
# You can use HTML text formatting in the file
# See the README for examples

# Licences
# On the main page of the repo, click [add file], [create new file]
# At repo/.... type licence
# Click [choose a licence template]
# MIT = people can use your code to use it and profit from it
# GNU = Scripts that use your code need to be open source
# Commit new file

# gitignore
# make a .gitignore file
# write down the files in that file that you want to ignore

# on github.com go the the repo. click [add file], [create new file]
# At repo/.... type .gitignore
# Click [choose .gitignore:]
# choose python or something else
# Can also ignore an entire direcotory
# Or use wildcards
# *.txt       #all .txt files
# *secret*    #all files containing secret


# branches
# in the desktop app, click [current branch] and make a new branch
# Commit and push changes to the new branch
# Change between branches to get the difference in files
# To merge the branches, make a pull request.
