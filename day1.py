# Git = command line tool to track changes.
# Github desktop does the same thing, but click based, user friendly.
# Github is the cloud where everything is stored


# Repository = repo = a folder on your computer that is tracked by git

# Better not use a dropbox or onedrive as local path.

# Make changes
# Commit to main = local repo
# Push to origin rempte (github)

# Revert a change:
# Go to history, right click the change you want to revert and 
# choose revert changes in commit

# If you make different changes, 
# you can commit them separately with separate comments

# You can make changes to files on github. This is not recommended.


# When changes are made somewhere else... on the desktop app
# Fetch, then Pull

# It is always a good idea to add a README.md (markdown file)
